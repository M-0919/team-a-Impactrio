                      easy and rewarding.

                      Inspired by the willingness to do more good, in August
                      2017 Malte founded We Volunteer as an online platform to
                      connect people and corporations to volunteering projects
                      and social initiatives. Anyone can easily find a social
                      project matching their skills and interests and get
                      involved. Since 2015, We Volunteer has grown in size and
                      scope and connected 250,000 unique users to more than
                      3,500 volunteer opportunities in 250 cities across Canada.

                      The Climate Action Network was founded with the goal of
                      uniting climate activists into a movement, with a strategy
                      of bottom-up organizing local-climate-focused campaigns
                      and projects around the world. Green Earth is an
                      educational and research organization dedicated to the
                      healing and harmonizing of the relationships between
                      humanity and the earth. Our objectives are to help bring
                      about changes in attitudes, values, perceptions, and world
                      views that are based on ecological balance and respect for
